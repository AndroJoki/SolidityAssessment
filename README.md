# SolidityAssessment
This Solidity program is about minting tokens and burning tokens. The purpose of this program is to help understand tokens and get a feel on how it works in Solidity.
# Description
This program is a Solidity-based smart contract designed for minting and burning tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It includes functions to create new tokens (mint) and destroy existing tokens (burn), allowing for dynamic management of token supply. This contract serves as a foundational example for developers looking to understand the basic operations of token supply control in Solidity, providing a stepping stone for more advanced token management systems in the future.
